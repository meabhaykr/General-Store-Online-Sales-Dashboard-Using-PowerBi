## Introduction

Welcome to the General Store Online Sales Dashboard project! This project aims to provide the owner of General Store with a powerful tool to track and analyze online sales data across India. The dashboard is created using Power BI, a Business Intelligence and Data Visualization tool, allowing for interactive exploration of key metrics and insights.

## Project Learnings

### 1. Interactive Dashboard Creation

We have designed an interactive dashboard that allows the user to easily track and analyze online sales data. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of various metrics and KPIs related to online sales.

### 2. Complex Parameters for Drill Down

To enhance the user experience, we have implemented complex parameters that enable drill-down functionality within the worksheet. This allows for a deeper analysis of specific aspects of the online sales data, providing more detailed insights.

### 3. Data Manipulation and Customization

We have implemented various data manipulation techniques, including creating connections, joining new tables, and performing calculations to manipulate the data. This customization enables the user to tailor the dashboard to their specific needs and requirements.

### 4. User-Driven Parameters for Visualizations

The dashboard features user-driven parameters that allow customization of visualizations. By incorporating filters and slicers, users can dynamically adjust the displayed data, providing a personalized and focused view of the online sales performance.

### 5. Diverse Visualization Types

We have utilized a wide range of visualization types to present the data effectively. This includes bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, slicers, and more. The diversity of visualizations ensures a comprehensive understanding of the online sales data.
